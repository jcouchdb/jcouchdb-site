First of all you need couchdb. jcouchdb is meant to run with couchdb 0.8+ currently only available per couchdb SVN. (the 0.8 version contains some breaking changes)

You'll need some libraries jcouchdb depends on. you can get these libraries either with the [http://jcouchdb.googlecode.com/files/jcouchdb-0.1-src.zip source download] or from SVN by either retrieving the complete project
{{{
svn co http://jcouchdb.googlecode.com/svn/trunk jcouchdb

or by just getting the jar files
{{{
svn co http://jcouchdb.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/lib/
